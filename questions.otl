Are we allowed to use the STL queue class? No. Also, don't use the pipe implementation.
When will we receive the BoolSource class from you? You are making your own.
What are appropriate simulations? Make up your own.
	How long it takes to take off and land will affect whether or not we need a new runway, and that varies with each run.
If we are to implement the extra credit features, we will need to change the number of arguments. How will we let you know this? README
